_PRINTF(3)

NAME
_printf - formatted output conversion

SYNOPSIS
_printf FORMAT [ARGUMENTS]...
_printf OPTIONS
DESCRIPTION
_printf is a custom implementation of the printf function. It performs formatted output conversion and writes the resulting string to the standard output stream.

The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching its argument.

CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS
A conversion specification consists of a % character followed by one or more of the following elements:

%c: The argument is a single character. The character is printed.
%s: The argument is a string. The string is printed.
%d, %i: The argument is an integer. The integer is printed as a signed decimal number.
%%: The argument is a % character. The % character is printed.
RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, _printf returns the number of characters printed. Otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate an error.

ERRORS
If the format string is NULL, _printf returns -1.
If an invalid conversion specification is encountered, _printf returns -1.
